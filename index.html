            <p>
                The sun, eight planets, and satellites make up the solar system. Asteroids, comets, dust, small planets, and gas are among the other objects found in space. <br> The Sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars make up the inner solar system,
                whereas the asteroid belt is between Mars and Jupiter’s orbit. According to our knowledge, there are around 500 solar systems in the universe. <br> The outer solar system planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The sun is at
                the centre of the solar system, and the planets revolve around it in their own orbits. <br> The rotation of the planets causes the days and nights, and the changing of seasons is caused by the revolution of the planets around the sun.
                Our solar system exists in the Milkyway galaxy. <br> According to scientists and astronomers, the earth is the only planetary body where life can exist. But this can be proven wrong after more discoveries about the universe.

                                <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. it is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars.</p>
                                <span style="display: block; margin: 10px;"></span>
                                <p>The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated over billions of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi), which is about
                                    one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by impact event
                                    remnants.Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2 ratio.</p>

                                    As of the early 2020s, many broad details of Mercury's geological history are still under investigation or pending data from space probes. Like other planets in the Solar System, Mercury was formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago.

                                <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a terrestrial planet and is the closest in mass and size to its orbital neighbour Earth. Venus has by far the densest atmosphere of the terrestrial planets, composed mostly
                                    of carbon dioxide with a thick, global sulfuric acid cloud cover. At the surface it has a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a pressure of 92 times that of Earth's at sea level. These extreme conditions
                                    compress carbon dioxide into a supercritical state at Venus's surface.Internally, Venus has a core, mantle, and crust. Venus lacks an internal dynamo, and its weakly induced magnetosphere is caused by atmospheric interactions
                                    with the solar wind. Internal heat escapes through active volcanism, resulting in resurfacing instead of plate tectonics. Venus is one of two planets in the Solar System, the other being Mercury, that have no moons.</p>

                                    our solar system, and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface. Earth is also unique in terms of monikers. Every other solar system planet was named for a Greek or Roman deity, but for at
                                    least a thousand years, some cultures have described our world using the Germanic word “earth,” which means simply “the ground.”</p>

                                <p>Earth rotates on its axis every 23.9 hours, defining day and night for surface dwellers. This axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees away from the plane of Earth's orbit around the sun, giving us seasons. Whichever hemisphere
                                    is tilted closer to the sun experiences summer, while the hemisphere tilted away gets winter. In the spring and fall, each hemisphere receives similar amounts of light. On two specific dates each year called the equinoxes
                                    both hemispheres get illuminated equally.</p>

                                <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. The surface of Mars is orange-red because it is covered in iron(III) oxide dust, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[22][23] Mars is among the brightest objects in Earth's sky,
                                    and its high-contrast albedo features have made it a common subject for telescope viewing. It is classified as a terrestrial planet and is the second smallest of the Solar System's planets with a diameter of 6,779 km
                                    (4,212 mi). In terms of orbital motion, a Martian solar day (sol) is equal to 24.5 hours, and a Martian solar year is equal to 1.88 Earth years (687 Earth days). Mars has two natural satellites that are small and irregular
                                    in shape: Phobos and Deimos.</p>

                                <p>The relatively flat plains in northern parts of Mars strongly contrast with the cratered terrain in southern highlands – this terrain observation is known as the Martian dichotomy. Mars hosts many enormous extinct volcanoes
                                    (the tallest is Olympus Mons, 21.9 km or 13.6 mi tall) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris, 4,000 km or 2,500 mi long).</p>

                                <p>Jupiter is a fascinating planet with many intriguing features: <br> Size and Composition: Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 142,984 km. It’s a gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen
                                    and helium1. Great Red Spot: One of its most famous features is the Great Red Spot, a massive storm that has been raging for at least 400 years. This storm is so large that three Earths could fit inside it2.</p>
                                <span style="display: block; margin: 10px;"></span>
                                <p>Moons: Jupiter has 79 known moons, with the four largest being the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 16103. Magnetic Field: Jupiter has the strongest magnetic
                                    field of any planet in our solar system, which is about 20,000 times stronger than Earth’s4.
                                    <br> Discovery : Jupiter has been known since ancient times due to its brightness in the night sky. However, the first detailed observations were made by Galileo Galilei in 1609 using a telescope. His discovery of Jupiter’s

                                <p>Saturn is a remarkable planet with many fascinating features: <br> - *Rings*: Saturn is best known for its stunning ring system, which is made up of ice and rock particles. These rings are divided into seven groups, named
                                    alphabetically in the order they were discovered
                                    <br> - *Size* and Composition*: Saturn is the second-largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 116,460 kilometers. Like Jupiter, it is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.
                                    <br> - *Moons*: Saturn has 83 known moons, with Titan being the largest. Titan is larger than the planet Mercury and has a thick atmosphere, making it one of the most intriguing moons in the solar system.
                                    <br> - *Magnetic Field*: Saturn has a strong magnetic field, though not as powerful as Jupiter's. This magnetic field is generated by the movement of metallic hydrogen within the planet.</p>
